# Challenge_1
Challenge 1 for DU Bootcamp. 
We were tasked with refactoring old cold for a webpage. We were to change the code to be more accessible and semantic without changing how the webpage works. We were then tasked with cleaning up and reorganizing the CSS file to become more sequential and concise. After the CSS was reorganized, we were to properly comment out what was happening and where in the CSS. Overall the HTML and CSS would have less lines, be more precise, and allow for more accessibility in the future.
